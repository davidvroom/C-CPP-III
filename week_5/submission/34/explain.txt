We implemented most of the aspects of the exercise. 
We used the 'main.cc.tmp' approach for handling the 
modification of an existing file.
Our code handles the code snippets as required.
However, we didn't know how to implement some aspects;
i.e. to start our little program we use './main main.cc',
instead of 'grab main.cc'. 
Also we wanted to match EOF by <<EOF>> within 'lexer',
and call our finish function (then we can make it private),
but matching <<EOF>> does not seem to work.
