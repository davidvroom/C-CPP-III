Why is a minimal match feature not required for flex? 

This is because flex chooses the more complicated implementation; 
the greedy variant, because by this flex prevents too early and 
therefore multiple parsing. If for specific cases a non-greedy 
match is needed, one can make a mini-scanner or use a look-ahead 
operator together with an end character that is not allowed for 
the greedy match.
